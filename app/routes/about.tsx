                    <p className={"pb-5"}>I'm a software developer based in Cincinnati, OH.
                        I am a husband to my amazing wife Cath and father to two lovely children, Anderson and Quinn.</p>

                    <p className={"pb-5"}>Apart from coding, I am an avid sports fan. I am a proud <span className={"text-red-600"}>University of Cincinnati Bearcat</span> alumni,
                        a <span className={"text-orange-500"}>Cincinnati Bengals</span> season ticket holder, and a die hard <span className={"text-green-600"}>Boston Celtics</span> fan.</p>

                    <p className={"pb-5"}>I love discovering new music and going to concerts. I also have a fairly large vinyl collection that I am pretty proud of.</p>

                    <p className={"pb-5"}>I am also a proud Apple fanboy üë®üèº‚Äçüíª, having worked at the Apple Store during my college days.
                        I started working there when they were still selling the original iPhone üì±.
                        The launch of the App Store and how it changed the way we interact with our phones is what inspired me to eventually become a developer</p>

                    <p className={"pb-5"}>I completed the <span className={"text-blue-300"}>Tech Elevator</span> Coding Bootcamp in 2020, and have since gained significant experience
                        in various coding technologies. I am proficient in Javascript, Typescript, React, Python, AWS, Swift, and SwiftUI, and am always eager to learn more.</p>

                    <p className={"pb-5"}>Currently, I work as a Developer at <span className={"text-purple-500"}>Pay Theory</span>, where I get to be a part of building
                        awesome payment solutions to help our partners enable inclusive payments int their platforms.</p>

                    <p className={"pb-5"}>This website is my playground, where I experiment with new technologies and share my passions
                        with the world. It was created using React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS, Remix, and Supabase.</p>

                    <p>Thank you for stopping by and getting to know me better. I am excited to continue to add to this site to let you get to know me better.</p>
